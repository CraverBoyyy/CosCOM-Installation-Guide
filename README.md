# CosCOM-Installation-Guide

This document will provide you to install the essential program for CosCOM 2024 workshop. There are 4 main programs that will be installed on your own computer. \
The first step that to install all these programs you need to set up the important compilers such as Python, OpenMPI, C, C++ etc. 

1. [Mathematica (Wolfram Engine) and Windows Subsystem for Linux and Terminal (For Windows User)](https://github.com/CraverBoyyy/CosCOM-Mathematica-Installation)
2. [Cobaya](https://github.com/CraverBoyyy/CosCOM-Cobaya)
3. [CLASS and Monte Python](https://github.com/CraverBoyyy/CosCOM-CLASS-Installation)

Bash scripting is an essential skill you need, as it is fundamental for installation to data analysis. If you have no experience with Bash scripting, such as using the Linux or Mac terminal, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with it before the first session of CosCOM. I have provided a necessary lesson covering the basics of Bash scripting. You can self-study using these resources as the first step in your computational cosmology study.
